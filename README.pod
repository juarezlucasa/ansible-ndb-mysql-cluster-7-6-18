=head1 Ansible Playbook for Mysql Cluster

Ansible playbook that install a Mysql-Cluster 7.3 for Linux x86_64, with support for multiple
clusters and a differant number of sql, data or management nodes.

=head2 Adding hosts

Just add your new host to the corresponding section and specify the cluster it
belongs to in the mysql_cluster variable.

  [mysql_cluster_data]
  ndb0 mysql_cluster=test
  ndb1 mysql_cluster=test
  [mysql_cluster_sql]
  ndb0 mysql_cluster=test
  ndb1 mysql_cluster=test
  [mysql_cluster_mgm]
  ndb-mgm mysql_cluster=test

=head2 Installation

  ansible-playbook -l ndb* --sudo  mysql-cluster.yaml

=head1 Limitations

It isn't possible to install other versions of Mysql-Cluster by setting a
variable. That should be easy to fix if somebody just checks the installation
paths and tries if the playbook still works with older or newer versions.
Patches are welcome... :)

which seems the be the best ressource on the web to get your mysql
cluster running. Even better than Oracles documentation under
